# simple-Philipps-Hue-Webapp
This is a dead simple web app to control your Philips Hue Smarthome Light Setup.

## reason
I always wanted to have an easy to use and nice looking webapp for my Hue setup at home.

Because I couldn't find one, I decided to develop my own.

## Things to know
- This is a super simple web application. 
- You can use it from within the wifi, which also connected to your Hue bridge.
- It has only a limited number of functionalites - just the ones I wanted to have.
- The API of Hue is well documented and you can extend this app by your self.

## technical things
- I decided to not come with a backend - it is all frontend code - pure Javascript.
- I also decided to not use frontend frameworks like Vue or React - felt like a bit of overkill for me.
- So the comes with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS and a bit of jQuery for some functionality stuff.
